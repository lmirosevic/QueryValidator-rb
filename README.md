QueryValidator
============

A simple JSON query validator for RESTful APIs written in Ruby.

Usage
------------

QueryValidator is designed for ensuring a payload a) contains all the necessary keys, b) the keys are of the correct type, and c) returns a pruned hash with only the stuff you want keyed using symbols. It supports optional fields as well as wildcard fields.

Include the module to save some typing:
```ruby
include Goonbee:QueryValidator
```

Suppose you require the user to send along a payload that looks something like:
```ruby
{
	"query": ""
}
```

A basic example:

```ruby
#
```

Suppose your API has a method that sends a message from one user to another located on /sendMessage and you want the client to pass along his/her authentication, target user's id, the message, a flag for whether to notify the recipient a priority, and a list of tags. A convenient way would be for the client to wrap all of those parameters into a JSON payload and send it inside a POST request:
```JSON
{
	"auth": {
		"userID": "abc123",
		"token": "12iu31b82736b"
	},
	"query": {
		"targetUserID": "def456",
		"notify": true,
		"priority": 2,
		"tags": ["greeting", "chitchat"],
		"message": "Hello dude!"
	}
}
```

Wouldn't it be nice if you could just convert that straight into a Ruby Hash that looks something like this... But raise an error in case some fields are missing or are of the wrong type?
```ruby
safe_verified_complete_hash = {
	:auth => {
		:userID => 'abc123',
		:token => '12iu31b82736b',
	},
	:query => {
		:targetUserID => 'def456',
		:notify => true,
		:priority => 2,
		:tags => ['greeting', 'chitchat'],
		:message => 'Hello dude!'
	}
}
```

Well with QueryValidator, all you have to do is provide that desired target payload as a template and the library will do the rest:
```ruby
raw_user_payload = ... #this is the raw user's payload

query_template = {
	:auth => {
		:userID => 'abc123',
		:token => '12iu31b82736b'
	},
	:query => {
		:targetUserID => 'def456',
		:notify => true,
		:priority => 2,
		:tags => ['greeting', 'chitchat'],
		:message => 'Hello dude!'
	}
}

safe_verified_complete_hash = Validator::process(query_template, raw_user_payload) #this will raise a `Goonbee::QueryValidator::MalformedQueryError` if the `raw_user_payload` did not match the template `query_template`.

#... use the hash with peace of mind
#eg:
sender_user_id = safe_verified_complete_hash[:auth][:userID] #this is now guaranteed to work
```

In the query template, your sample values don't have to be so long, the QueryValidator just makes sure that they are the correct type, so in practice one would do:
```ruby
raw_user_payload = ... #this is the raw user's payload

safe_verified_complete_hash = Validator::process({
	:auth => {					#hash
		:userID => '',			#string
		:token => ''			#string
	},
	:query => {					#hash
		:targetUserID => ''		#string
		:notify => true,		#boolean
		:priority => 0,			#number
		:tags => [''],			#array of string
		:message => ''			#string
	}
}, raw_user_payload) #raises error if raw query doesn't match

#...do something with the hash
```

Wildcards are also supported, this one is special, so if your message is dynamic and could be many different things you would specify the value as '_':
```ruby
hash = Validator::process({
	:auth => {					#hash
		:userID => '',			#string
		:token => ''			#string
	},
	:query => {					#hash
		:targetUserID => ''		#string
		:notify => true,		#boolean
		:priority => 0,			#number
		:tags => [''],			#array of string
		:message => '_'			#anything: hash, array, string, boolean or number
	}
}, raw_user_payload)
```

Optional fields are also supported, so if tags are say optional, then you could prefix the key with an underscore, something like this:
```ruby
hash = Validator::process({
	:auth => {					#hash
		:userID => '',			#string
		:token => ''			#string
	},
	:query => {					#hash
		:targetUserID => ''		#string
		:notify => true,		#boolean
		:priority => 0,			#number
		:_tags => [''],			#optional array of string
		:message => ''			#string
	}
}, raw_user_payload)

has_tags = hash[:query].has_key?(:tags)	#N.B. the underscore is only in the query, the key in the resulting hash is `:tags`
tags = hash[:query][:tags] if has_tags
```

It's a super simple library where the focus is on representing the template query as closesly as possible to an example query. This makes the templates easy to write, maintain and read.
